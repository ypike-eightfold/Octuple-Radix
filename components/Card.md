Component: Card
Overview
A card UI component is a rectangular container that groups related information together. It is typically used to display a single piece of content, such as a product, a blog post, or a user profile.    

When to Use
Use Card when: Displaying collections of distinct items (products, articles), summarizing information, or creating dashboard widgets.    

Consider other components if: Displaying simple lists (use List) or tabular data (use Table).    

Best Practices
Keep content concise and focused.    

Maintain consistent card layouts.    

Ensure cards are responsive.    

Things to Avoid
Don't overload cards with too much information or too many actions.    

Avoid inconsistent card heights in a grid unless intentional (masonry).
