Component: Popover
Overview
The Popover displays additional content in a floating overlay, richer than a Tooltip, triggered by hover or click.    

When to Use
Use Popover when: Displaying detailed info (profile summary), contextual actions, compact forms, or content too rich for a Tooltip.    

Consider other components if: Brief non-interactive text (Tooltip), or critical/blocking content (Dialog/Modal).    

Best Practices
Keep content concise and relevant.    

Provide clear dismissal (click outside, Escape, close button).    

Use a title if it adds context.    

Things to Avoid
Don't overload with content.    

Don't use for essential information (should be visible by default).    

Key Properties (API Highlights)
content: (string/node) Main popover content.    

title: (string/node) Optional title.    

trigger: (hover, focus, click).    

placement: Position relative to trigger.    

visible/open: (boolean) Controlled visibility.    

children: (node) The trigger element.    

arrow: (boolean or object).    

Accessibility Considerations
Trigger is focusable. If popover contains interactive elements, keyboard navigation into/within popover must be supported.    

aria-describedby on trigger can link to popover content.    

Escape key should dismiss.
