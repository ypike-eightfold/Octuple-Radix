# Accessibility Evaluation

- Date (UTC): 2025-09-15T00-00-00Z
- Scope: Prototype › Configuration panel (Generate QR code)
- Evaluator: AI assistant
- Sources: WCAG 2.2 AA; system/evaluations/a11y/guidance documents/info.md; Octuple component docs

## Executive summary
Overall a11y is reasonable using Octuple components. Key issues: muted label contrast in light theme, missing semantic grouping for related inputs, QR code needs accessible name/description, and focus return behavior should be confirmed.

## Method
- Standards: WCAG 2.2 AA
- Tools: manual review and code inspection
- Guidance: a11y guidance (info.md)

## Findings by success criterion
- SC 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) — Severity 3
  - Location: Section labels (Target, Job type, Preview) and checkbox labels.
  - Evidence: Octuple defaults render muted label color. We overrode to primary but some subcomponents may still reduce opacity.
  - Recommendation: Apply a panel-scoped CSS class or Octuple theming to force primary text color with 100% opacity; verify contrast ≥ 4.5:1 on the panel surface.

- SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships — Severity 3
  - Location: “Target” and “Job type” input groups.
  - Evidence: Visual grouping only; no programmatic grouping.
  - Recommendation: Wrap in <fieldset> with <legend>, or add role="group" with aria-labelledby pointing to the group label.

- SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value — Severity 3
  - Location: QR code graphic.
  - Evidence: `<QRCode />` renders an SVG without an accessible name/description.
  - Recommendation: Add `aria-label` (e.g., "QR code for {URL}") or surrounding description via `aria-describedby` to the QR container.

- SC 2.4.3 Focus Order / SC 2.1.1 Keyboard — Severity 4
  - Location: Panel open/close behavior.
  - Evidence: Panel traps focus and supports Esc; not explicitly restoring focus to trigger on close.
  - Recommendation: Save the opener button ref and restore focus after closing.

- SC 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast — Severity 4
  - Location: Focus indicators in Tabs and buttons.
  - Evidence: Relying on Octuple defaults; likely sufficient but unverified in current theme.
  - Recommendation: Verify focus ring contrast ≥ 3:1 against adjacent colors.

## Conformance and prioritization
- Priorities: 1) Contrast enforcement and group semantics; 2) Accessible name for QR; 3) Focus return and focus-ring verification.

## Appendix
- Tested in Vite dev using Octuple components and theme tokens.
