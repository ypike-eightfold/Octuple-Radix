## Content Design Guidance (info.md)

### Purpose

### Default standards and best practices
- Clarity and brevity; prioritize user goals and task completion.
- Plain language; avoid jargon, define necessary terms.
- Information hierarchy and scannability (headings, bullets, short paragraphs).
- Voice and tone guidelines; consistency across flows.
- Inclusive and bias-free language.
- Terminology and naming consistency across product surfaces.
- Microcopy patterns for actions, errors, empty states, and confirmations.

  - Brand voice and tone guide
  - Terminology glossary
  - Content style guide
  - Error message patterns

### Report expectations
