## Heuristic Evaluation Guidance (info.md)

### Purpose
- Central guidance for heuristic evaluations. Use these defaults when no other specific docs are present.

### Default standards and best practices
- Primary framework: Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.
- Considerations: error prevention and recovery, match with real-world language, recognition over recall, flexibility and efficiency, consistency and standards, minimalist design, help and documentation.
- May include platform conventions (web, iOS, Android) where relevant.

### Organization-specific rules (add links/notes here)
- Add any documents in this folder that tailor or extend the heuristic set, for example:
  - Internal usability principles
  - Navigation and IA rules
  - Component usage and interaction patterns

### Report expectations
- Use the Heuristic template defined in `../../exe.md`.
- Group findings by heuristic; apply the shared severity scale.
- Cite any docs in this folder under "Sources".

### Ownership
- Maintained by Functional Leads: UXR (primary), with collaboration from Content Design and Design Systems.

### Version history
- YYYY-MM-DD: Initial version.
