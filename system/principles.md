Octuple Design System Guiding Principles
These are the core principles that guide the development and evolution of the Octuple Design System.    

Accessibility First: Design and build for everyone, regardless of ability. Ensure usability and full participation by adhering to established standards like WCAG 2.1 AA and Section 508. Compassion and extreme ownership drive our commitment to inclusive products for users including those who are blind, have limited vision, are deaf, have limited mobility, or are sensory-sensitive.    

Atomic and Modular Structure: Construct interfaces with a deliberate order and hierarchy, based on the Atomic Design methodology. Build from the smallest "Nucleus" (Design Tokens) through "Atoms" (e.g., Buttons, TextFields) and "Molecules" (e.g., Search Bar) to "Organisms" (e.g., Modals), ensuring a scalable and maintainable system.    

Clear Communication through Design Tokens: Employ Design Tokens as the shared language for design decisions. These named entities for values like color, typography, spacing, and animation ensure consistency and clear communication between designers and developers, making the design system understandable and enforceable.    

Harmony Inspired by Nature & The Golden Ratio: Draw inspiration from the patterns and proportions found in nature, such as the Golden Ratio (Divine Proportion) and Fibonacci sequences, to create aesthetically pleasing, balanced, and organically structured user interfaces. Use the natural world as a starting point for open-ended and humbling design explorations.    

Systematic Color Usage: Leverage the understanding of the visible spectrum and color theory, as exemplified by Newton's color wheel. Apply colors systematically to create harmonious relationships, convey meaning effectively, and ensure visual clarity across all products.    

Built for Scalability: Prioritize scalability in all design and development decisions to ensure lower maintenance costs, better user experience, and higher agility. Utilize stable foundational structures, such as systems based on divisible numbers like 4 and 8, to support robust and adaptable enterprise software.    

Extreme Ownership & Compassion: Embrace a culture of extreme ownership over the quality, usability, and accessibility of our products. Approach design challenges with compassion for our users, striving to understand and meet their diverse needs.
