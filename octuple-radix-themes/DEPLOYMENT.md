# Deployment Solutions

This document outlines multiple deployment strategies for the Octuple Radix Storybook.

## Current Status 

We have implemented multiple deployment approaches to resolve persistent 404 errors:

### 1. GitHub Pages (Manual gh-pages Branch) ‚úÖ Implemented

**URL:** https://ypike-eightfold.github.io/Octuple-Radix/

**How it works:**
- Built Storybook locally (`npm run build-storybook`)
- Created dedicated `gh-pages` branch with only production files
- Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
- Pushed to GitHub for traditional branch-based Pages deployment

**Advantages:**
- More reliable than GitHub Actions approach
- Direct control over deployed files
- Traditional, well-tested method

### 2. Netlify (Backup Solution) ‚úÖ Ready

**Configuration:** `netlify.toml` file created

**Setup:**
1. Connect GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Netlify will automatically detect `netlify.toml` configuration
3. Builds will run automatically on each push to `main`

**Advantages:**
- Excellent Storybook support
- Fast global CDN
- Automatic builds on git push
- Better performance than GitHub Pages

### 3. GitHub Actions (Legacy) ‚ö†Ô∏è Has Issues

**Status:** Previously implemented but experiencing 404 errors

**Configuration:** `.github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml`

**Issues:**
- Silent deployment failures
- Base path configuration problems
- GitHub Pages API limitations

## Recommendations

1. **Primary:** Use the manual GitHub Pages deployment (gh-pages branch)
2. **Backup:** Set up Netlify for automatic deployments
3. **Debug:** GitHub Actions if needed for CI/CD integration

## Manual Deployment Process

```bash
# Build Storybook
npm run build-storybook

# Switch to gh-pages branch
git checkout gh-pages

# Copy built files to root
cp -r storybook-static/* .
touch .nojekyll

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "üöÄ Deploy Storybook update"
git push origin gh-pages

# Switch back to main
git checkout main
```
